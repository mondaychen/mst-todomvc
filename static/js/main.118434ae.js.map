Including the modifiers like `asFlat`.\n\t * - utils/   Utility stuff.\n\t *\n\t */\n\tvar extras = {\n\t    allowStateChanges: allowStateChanges,\n\t    deepEqual: deepEqual,\n\t    getAtom: getAtom,\n\t    getDebugName: getDebugName,\n\t    getDependencyTree: getDependencyTree,\n\t    getAdministration: getAdministration,\n\t    getGlobalState: getGlobalState,\n\t    getObserverTree: getObserverTree,\n\t    interceptReads: interceptReads,\n\t    isComputingDerivation: isComputingDerivation,\n\t    isSpyEnabled: isSpyEnabled,\n\t    onReactionError: onReactionError,\n\t    reserveArrayBuffer: reserveArrayBuffer,\n\t    resetGlobalState: resetGlobalState,\n\t    shareGlobalState: shareGlobalState,\n\t    spyReport: spyReport,\n\t    spyReportEnd: spyReportEnd,\n\t    spyReportStart: spyReportStart,\n\t    setReactionScheduler: setReactionScheduler\n\t};\n\tvar everything = {\n\t    Reaction: Reaction,\n\t    untracked: untracked,\n\t    Atom: Atom, BaseAtom: BaseAtom,\n\t    useStrict: useStrict, isStrictModeEnabled: isStrictModeEnabled,\n\t    spy: spy,\n\t    asReference: asReference, asFlat: asFlat, asStructure: asStructure, asMap: asMap,\n\t    isModifierDescriptor: isModifierDescriptor,\n\t    isObservableObject: isObservableObject,\n\t    isBoxedObservable: isObservableValue,\n\t    isObservableArray: isObservableArray,\n\t    ObservableMap: ObservableMap, isObservableMap: isObservableMap, map: map,\n\t    transaction: transaction,\n\t    observable: observable,\n\t    computed: computed,\n\t    isObservable: isObservable,\n\t    isComputed: isComputed,\n\t    extendObservable: extendObservable, extendShallowObservable: extendShallowObservable,\n\t    observe: observe,\n\t    intercept: intercept,\n\t    autorun: autorun, autorunAsync: autorunAsync, when: when, reaction: reaction,\n\t    action: action, isAction: isAction, runInAction: runInAction,\n\t    expr: expr,\n\t    toJS: toJS,\n\t    createTransformer: createTransformer,\n\t    whyRun: whyRun,\n\t    isArrayLike: isArrayLike,\n\t    extras: extras,\n\t};\n\tvar warnedAboutDefaultExport = false;\n\tvar _loop_1 = function (p) {\n\t    var val = everything[p];\n\t    Object.defineProperty(everything, p, {\n\t        get: function () {\n\t            if (!warnedAboutDefaultExport) {\n\t                warnedAboutDefaultExport = true;\n\t                console.warn('Using default export (`import mobx from \\'mobx\\'`) is deprecated ' +\n\t                    'and won’t work in mobx@4.0.0\\n' +\n\t                    'Use `import * as mobx from \\'mobx\\'` instead');\n\t            }\n\t            return val;\n\t        }\n\t    });\n\t};\n\tfor (var p in everything) {\n\t    _loop_1(p);\n\t}\n\tif (typeof __MOBX_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__ === \"object\") {\n\t    __MOBX_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__.injectMobx({ spy: spy, extras: extras });\n\t}\n\t\n\texports.extras = extras;\n\texports['default'] = everything;\n\texports.Reaction = Reaction;\n\texports.untracked = untracked;\n\texports.Atom = Atom;\n\texports.BaseAtom = BaseAtom;\n\texports.useStrict = useStrict;\n\texports.isStrictModeEnabled = isStrictModeEnabled;\n\texports.spy = spy;\n\texports.asReference = asReference;\n\texports.asFlat = asFlat;\n\texports.asStructure = asStructure;\n\texports.asMap = asMap;\n\texports.isModifierDescriptor = isModifierDescriptor;\n\texports.isObservableObject = isObservableObject;\n\texports.isBoxedObservable = isObservableValue;\n\texports.isObservableArray = isObservableArray;\n\texports.ObservableMap = ObservableMap;\n\texports.isObservableMap = isObservableMap;\n\texports.map = map;\n\texports.transaction = transaction;\n\texports.observable = observable;\n\texports.IObservableFactories = IObservableFactories;\n\texports.computed = computed;\n\texports.isObservable = isObservable;\n\texports.isComputed = isComputed;\n\texports.extendObservable = extendObservable;\n\texports.extendShallowObservable = extendShallowObservable;\n\texports.observe = observe;\n\texports.intercept = intercept;\n\texports.autorun = autorun;\n\texports.autorunAsync = autorunAsync;\n\texports.when = when;\n\texports.reaction = reaction;\n\texports.action = action;\n\texports.isAction = isAction;\n\texports.runInAction = runInAction;\n\texports.expr = expr;\n\texports.toJS = toJS;\n\texports.createTransformer = createTransformer;\n\texports.whyRun = whyRun;\n\texports.isArrayLike = isArrayLike;\n\t\n\t/* WEBPACK VAR INJECTION */}.call(exports, (function() { return this; }())))\n\n/***/ },\n/* 59 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t/**\n\t * Copyright 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n\t * All rights reserved.\n\t *\n\t * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n\t * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.
